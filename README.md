  Your vaults, encrypted and in your hands.

## üöÄ About the Project

**KeepMeSafe** is a minimalist, self-hosted password manager built with Django and SQLite.  
It allows users to create separate encrypted vaults under different profiles, each protected with a master key.  
Inspired by simplicity and security, KeepMeSafe is perfect for individual use or as a base for more complex multi-user systems.

## üöß How to Run

### Manually

First clone the repository in your machine and install the dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pointedsec/keepmesafe.git
cd keepmesafe
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then edit the `.env` file to your preferences.
```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=SUPER_SECREY_KEY
DEBUG=False
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*
ADMIN_VAULT_PASSWORD=admin
```
`ADMIN_VAULT_PASSWORD` is the required administration password to create new vaults. This prevents any random person on the internet from creating vaults in your application.

Lastly, run the migrations, collect the static files, and execute the server, you can use `gunicorn` if you want to.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
DOCKER=False python manage.py runserver
```

> **_NOTE:_**  You need to specify the `DOCKER` env variable in the execution runtime to make KeepMeSafe to load the environment variables

The app will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000


### Using Docker
First clone the repository in your machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pointedsec/keepmesafe.git
cd keepmesafe
```

Then edit the `.env` file to your preferences.
```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=SUPER_SECREY_KEY
DEBUG=False
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*
ADMIN_VAULT_PASSWORD=admin
```

Now build the docker image
```bash
docker build -t keepmesafe .
```

And now use docker compose to create an instance of the image.
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin Key Protection

To prevent unauthorized access to profile creation:
The admin key is configured in settings.py as `ADMIN_CREATION_KEY`, you can set it through the `.env` file.
Any attempt to access `/create_profile/` will require this key.
